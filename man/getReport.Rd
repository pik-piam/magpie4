\usage{
getReport(
  gdx,
  file = NULL,
  scenario = NULL,
  filter = c(1, 2, 7),
  detail = TRUE,
  level = "regglo",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.report.
If NULL the report is returned instead as a MAgPIE object.}

\item{scenario}{Name of the scenario used for the list-structure of a
reporting object (x$scenario$MAgPIE).
If NULL the report is returned instead as a MAgPIE object.}

\item{filter}{Modelstat filter. Here you have to set the modelstat values
for which results should be used.
All values for time steps in which the modelstat is different
or for which one of the previous modelstats were different are set to NA.}

\item{detail}{Crop specific (TRUE) or aggregated outputs (FALSE)}

\item{level}{An aggregation level (currently "regglo" or "iso") or the name of a mapping
that should be used by default to aggregate the report. Not all parts of 
the report will necessarily adhere to this.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for write.report.
Will only be taken into account if argument "file" is not NULL.}
}
\value{
A MAgPIE object containing the report in the case that "file" is NULL.
}
\description{
Puts together a report based on a MAgPIE gdx file
}
\details{
Reports are organize with '|' as level delimiter and summation symbols
         for grouping subcategories into entities e.g. for stackplots.
         Notice the following hints for the summation symbol placement:
\itemize{
  \item Every name should just contain one summation symbol (mostly '+').
  \item The position of the symbol (counted in '|' from left side) will determine the level.
  \item Every subitem containing the same summation symbol in the same level
        with the same supercategory name will be summed.
  \item Items without any summation symbol will ge ignored.
  \item Items with different summation symbols will be summed up separately.
  \item In most of the cases a summation symbol will be just placed
        before the last level (counted in '|' from left side).
  \item It is helpful to think about which group of items should be stacked in a stackplot.
}
  An example how a summation symbol placement could look like:
  \preformatted{  Toplevel
  Toplevel|+|Item 1
  Toplevel|+|Item 2
  Toplevel|Item 2|+|Subitem 1
  Toplevel|Item 2|+|Subitem 1
  Toplevel|++|Item A
  Toplevel|++|Item B
  Toplevel|Item ?}
}
