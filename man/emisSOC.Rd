\usage{
emisSOC(gdx, file = NULL, sumLand = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie}

\item{sumLand}{TRUE (default) or FALSE. Sum over land types (TRUE)
or report land-type specific emissions (FALSE).}
}
\value{
CO2 emissions as MAgPIE object
}
\description{
Reads detailed CO2 soil emissions out of a MAgPIE gdx file using
             Shapley-style decomposition with interaction terms
}
\details{
This function uses a structural decomposition approach (Shapley decomposition)
to attribute soil carbon emissions to different drivers and their interactions.
The mathematical framework is based on counterfactual analysis where we
systematically vary each driver while holding others constant.

For n drivers (D1, D2, ..., Dn), the total emission change is decomposed as:

??Emissions = ??(main_effects) + ??(1st_order_interactions) +
             ??(2nd_order_interactions) + ... + nth_order_interaction + residual

Where:
- Main effects: ??Stock(Di changes, all others constant)
- 1st order interactions: ??Stock(Di, Dj change) - ??Stock(Di) - ??Stock(Dj)
- Higher order terms follow the same inclusion-exclusion principle

Drivers included:
- Climate (C): Changes in reference soil carbon density
- Land-use (LU): Transitions between land types
- Management (M): Changes in crop type shares, fallow, and treecover
  * Can be split into treecover vs other management in attribution
- Soil Carbon Management (SCM): Enhanced soil carbon practices

Legacy effects are incorporated using exponential decay over 100 years.
