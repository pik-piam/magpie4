\usage{
emisSOC(gdx, file = NULL, sumLand = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie}

\item{sumLand}{TRUE (default) or FALSE. Sum over land types (TRUE)
or report land-type specific emissions (FALSE).}
}
\value{
CO2 emissions as MAgPIE object
}
\description{
Reads detailed CO2 soil emissions out of a MAgPIE gdx file using
             Shapley-style decomposition with interaction terms
}
\details{
This function uses a structural decomposition approach (Shapley decomposition)
to attribute soil carbon emissions to different drivers and their interactions.
The framework is based on counterfactual analysis where all possible combinations
of driver states are evaluated following the inclusion-exclusion principle.

For four drivers, the total emission is decomposed as:

totEmissions = main_effects + first_order_interactions +
               second_order_interactions + third_order_interactions + residual

This creates 16 counterfactual scenarios (2^4) to isolate individual and combined
effects. Main effects capture changes when one driver varies while others stay
constant. Interaction terms capture synergies where driver combinations amplify
or dampen effects beyond simple addition.

Drivers included:
- Climate (C): Changes in reference soil carbon density
- Land-use (LU): Transitions between land types
- Management (M): Changes in crop type shares, fallow, and treecover
  * Can be split into treecover vs other management in attribution
- Soil Carbon Management (SCM): Enhanced soil carbon practices

Legacy effects are incorporated using exponential decay (85% remaining per year)
over 100 years. Interaction terms are proportionally attributed back to main
drivers in the final output.
