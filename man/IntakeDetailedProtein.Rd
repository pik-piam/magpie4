IntakeDetailedProtein(
  gdx,
  level = "reg",
  target_diet = F,
  magpie_input = "auto",
  product_aggr = FALSE,
  dir = ".",
  spamfiledirectory = "",
  file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{level}{Level of regional aggregation; "reg" (regional), "glo" (global), "regglo" (regional and global) or any other aggregation level defined in superAggregate}

\item{target_diet}{returns target diet of dietary transformation in case of exogenous diet scenarios (boolean); 
in case of endogenous diets, no target diet is defined and the function returns an object filled with 0.}

\item{magpie_input}{Available modes are "auto" (default), TRUE or FALSE. 
This setting is only activate if argument "target_diet" is set to FALSE and else ignored. 
If set as TRUE, the per-capita kcal intake values finally entering MAgPIE as input are used, which drive the behaviour of 
the MAgPIE model. In cases where exogenous diet scenarios (e.g. EAT Lancet diets) are simulated, these input values can diverge 
from the (calibrated) regression outputs from the food demand model. 
If set as FALSE, the per-capita kcal intake values as calculated in the food demand model are used, which might be 
overwritten in the MAgPIE simulation in the case of exogenous diet scenarios (e.g. EAT Lancet diets). 
The default setting "auto" detects automatically, if an exogenous scenario for per-capita kcal intake is simulated by MAgPIE,
and uses the respective settings: 1) magpie input in case of exogenous scenarios and 2) estimates from the food demand model in
case of endogenous scenarios.}

\item{product_aggr}{aggregate over products or not (boolean)}

\item{dir}{for gridded outputs: magpie output directory which contains a mapping file (rds or spam) disaggregation}

\item{spamfiledirectory}{deprecated. please use \code{dir} instead}

\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie}
}
\value{
Protein intake as MAgPIE object (unit: grams/cap/day)
}
\description{
Calculates food-specific per-capita protein intake from magpie results in grams. Only calculates the protein content of food intake estimated by the food demand model, and not of food intake that is prescribed in the case of exogenous diet scenarios (e.g. EAT Lancet diets).
